## Marking
I would go through the Python file and the HTML file only, as those are the only relevant ones 
to the content of this culminating

## What I learned
- Decorators are heavily used throughout all of programming in both Java and Python
- A stronger understanding of OOP programming by creating my own custom class, not inherited from a library
- All attributes of my object were created by me and I had never done that before
- The ability to learn new frameworks quickly by relating them to past knowledge. I made alot of connections between OOP and Flasks framework.
- The joy and challenge of making new projects. There is a lot of creativity that went into this project, for example, how I had to take in a submit button
  and identify which scholarship was clicked, and then modify that specific scholarship. There were many ways I could have gone about it, and picking the "best" method was fun.
  I pondered using an ID, but I needed an input form or it couldnt return the information to the backend. Or I could tag each button with its own name. In the end, I went with a hidden ghost button
  that became submitted once the edit button was pressed, and this button returned the name of the scholarship.
